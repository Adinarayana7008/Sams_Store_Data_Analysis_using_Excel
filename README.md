# Steps Followed:
These are some steps that I followed during the project:
1. Data Cleaning: In this step includes removing inconsistencies in data, errors, and duplicates and ensuring that the data with which I worked is accurate and reliable for further analysis.

2. Data Processing: Creating some new columns that involved organizing, sorting, and filtering the data to extract meaningful insights.

3. Data Analysis: Used various statistical methods to get valuable insights from the data.

4. Data Visualization: Used Excel as a visualization tool. With the help of this, I have created attractive charts, graphs, and interactive visuals to present the data in an easy way.

5. Dashboard Making: Finally, I built a dashboard in Excel by inserting slicers that allow users to interact with the data.
